Great news! You're going to an NBA game! The only catch is that you've been volunteered to keep stats at the game.

Using Nested Hashes, define a game, with two teams, their players, and the players stats:

- The game has two teams.
- A team has:
  - A name
  - Two colors
- Each team should have at least 5 players
- Each player should have a:
  - name
  - number (like their jersey number)
  - shoe size

- Each player should have the following stats:
  - points
  - rebounds
  - assists
  - steals
  - blocks
  - slam dunks

Using the power of Ruby, and the Hashes you created above, answer the following questions:

1. Return the number of points scored for any player.

2. Return the shoe size for any player.

3. Return both colors for any team.

4. Return both teams names.

5. Return all the player numbers for a team.

6. Return all the stats for a player.

7. Return the rebounds for the player with the largest shoe size.

**Bonus Questions:**

Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:

1. Which player has the most points?

2. Which team has the most points?

3. Which player has the longest name?

**Super Bonus:**

Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the most steals
